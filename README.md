# ITGlue-Scripting-Public
This is a public repository of scripts that were developed internally at IT Guru by Adam Ellch, which we felt may be useful to the wider community

Clear-ITGlueOrphanConfiguratins was written to help clean up orphan configuratinos across all customers, and can be ran in several different modes with parameters and examples for most use casees.  It was written with the intention of running it from the PowerShell ISE, and may not work as expected if ran from the cmdline of VS Code
